Trees


Trees are an essential data structure for storing hierarchical data with a directed flow.
root node is at the very top and this is also a parent.
child or children nodes
When a node has no children, we refer to it as a leaf node.


Binary Search Tree

A binary tree is a type of tree where each parent can have no more than two children, known as the left child and right child.

review:

parent: A node which references other nodes.
child: Nodes referenced by other nodes.
sibling: Nodes which have the same parent.
leaf: Nodes which have no children.
level: The height or depth of the tree. Root nodes are at level 1, their children are at level 2, and so on.



TreeNodes:

have a value
have a reference to zero or more other TreeNodes
can add a node as a child
can remove a child
can traverse (or travel through) connected nodes





class TreeNode:
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
    self.children = []

  def __repr__(self, level=0):
    # HELPER METHOD TO PRINT TREE!
    ret = "--->" * level + repr(self.value) + "\n"
    for child in self.children:
      ret += child.__repr__(level+1)
    return ret

  def add_child(self, child_node):
    self.children.append(child_node) 

### TEST CODE TO PRINT TREE
company = [
  "Monkey Business CEO", 
  "VP of Bananas", 
  "VP of Lazing Around", 
  "Associate Chimp", 
  "Chief Bonobo", "Produce Manager", "Tire Swing R & D"]
root = TreeNode(company.pop(0))
for count in range(2):
  child = TreeNode(company.pop(0))
  root.add_child(child)

root.children[0].add_child(TreeNode(company.pop(0)))
root.children[0].add_child(TreeNode(company.pop(0)))
root.children[1].add_child(TreeNode(company.pop(0)))
root.children[1].add_child(TreeNode(company.pop(0)))
print("MONKEY BUSINESS, LLC.")
print("=====================")
print(root)

Heaps


We will focus on min-heaps, but the concepts for a max-heap are nearly identical.

Think of the min-heap as a binary tree with two qualities:

The root is the minimum value of the dataset.
Every childs value is greater than its parent.
These two properties are the defining characteristics of the min-heap. By maintaining these two properties, we can efficiently retrieve and update the minimum value.

Removing an Element: Heapify Down
Adding an Element: Heapify Up # the element is adde at the bottom 

left child: (index * 2) + 1
right child: (index * 2) + 2
parent: (index - 1) / 2 â€” not used on the root!
