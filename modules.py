# A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool.
# Modules are also often referred to as "libraries" or "packages" â€” a package is really a directory that holds a collection of modules.

#Let's get started by importing and using the datetime module. In this case, you'll notice that datetime is both the name of the library and the name of the object that you are importing.

random.choice() # which takes a list as an argument and returns a number from the list
random.randint() # which takes two numbers as arguments and generates a random number between the two numbers you passed in




# Import random below:
import random

# Create random_list below:
random_list = [random.randint(1,101) for i in range(101)]

# Create randomer_number below:
randomer_number = random.choice(random_list)

# Print randomer_number below:
print(randomer_number)
